RULE 115: RECORDING HEARINGS

All hearings, except ex parte hearings, shall be audio recorded by the clerk of the court and retained for a minimum of one year from the date of the final disposition of the case.

Advisory Commission Comments:

The rule establishes that juvenile courts function as courts of record under Tennessee Code Annotated Sections 37-1-124(c) and 37-1-159(a). Courts must create and maintain audio recordings of all juvenile court hearings alongside appropriate hearing minutes. The rule permits alternative recording methods, including audio-visual equipment, and does not restrict simultaneous recording by court reporters or other parties.

The rule explicitly excludes foster care review board proceedings from its requirements.
