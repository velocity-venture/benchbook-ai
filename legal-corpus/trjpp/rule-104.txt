RULE 104: APPEARANCE OF ATTORNEY

(a) Entry of Appearance. An attorney who undertakes to represent a party in any juvenile court action shall immediately notify the court, unless appointed by written order of the court.

(b) Continued Representation. An attorney who has entered an appearance or who has been appointed by the court shall continue such representation until relieved by order of the court.

(c) Prosecuting Attorney. Whenever required by statute or rule, or at his or her discretion, the district attorney general shall appear in the juvenile court and prosecute on behalf of the state.

Advisory Commission Comments:

The Commission emphasizes careful attention to section (b), noting that attorneys remain the official representative of record once appointed or entered unless a court order releases them from that obligation. Additionally, youth services officers and other court staff members should not assume prosecutorial roles in juvenile proceedings, though they may serve as petitioners or witnesses.
