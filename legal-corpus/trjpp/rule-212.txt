RULE 212: PROBATION OR HOME PLACEMENT SUPERVISION VIOLATION

(a) Procedure. Proceedings to establish a violation of the conditions of probation or home placement supervision shall be conducted in the same manner as proceedings on petitions alleging delinquent conduct. A child facing such proceedings receives the same protections as those alleged to be delinquent. A petition is mandatory for probation violations and for home placement supervision violations when the child has been released from Department of Children's Services custody. The petition must identify the sought remedy and factual basis.

(b) Burden of Proof. The standard is a preponderance of the evidence.

(c) Disposition. If a violation is found, the court may make any other disposition which would have been permissible in the original proceeding, subject to applicable Tennessee Code Annotated provisions.

Advisory Commission Comments:

The rule distinguishes between probation (state or county) and home placement supervision (aftercare for children previously in state custody). Petitions are required when children not in state custody violate aftercare conditions, and hearings must occur within seven days if detention is involved.
