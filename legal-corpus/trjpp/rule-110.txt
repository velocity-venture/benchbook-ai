RULE 110: TIME

(a) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed by these rules, by order of court, or by any applicable statute, the date of the act, event or default is not to be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless:

(1) it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday as defined in Tenn. Code Ann. Section 15-1-101, or

(2) the act to be done is the filing of a paper in court, and the last day is a day on which the office of the court clerk is closed or on which weather or other conditions have made the office of the court clerk inaccessible.

In either instance, the event period runs until the end of the next day which is not one of the aforementioned days. Absent statutory authority or a Rule of Juvenile Procedure to the contrary, when the period of time prescribed or allowed is less than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded in the computation.

(b) Extension. For cause shown, the court may extend the period of time to perform an act if the request is made prior to the expiration of the period originally prescribed. However, upon motion made after the expiration of the specified period of time to perform an act, the court may permit the act to be done where the failure to act was the result of excusable neglect. This subdivision does not apply to the time for scheduling a detention or preliminary hearing, holding hearings regarding the violation of a valid court order, filing a notice of appeal or request for hearing before the judge from the magistrate's order.

(c) Exceptions. This rule does not apply to the time provided to:

(1) serve a summons or subpoena;

(2) make a probable cause determination pursuant to Rules 203 and 302;

(3) ratify a permanency plan pursuant to T.C.A. Section 37-2-403(a); or

(4) hold a permanency hearing pursuant to T.C.A. Sections 37-1-166(g)(5) and 37-2-409.
