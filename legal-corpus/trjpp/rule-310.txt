RULE 310: MODIFICATION OF OR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENTS OR ORDERS

(a) Modification of Orders.

(1) Clerical Mistakes. Courts may correct clerical errors at any time, either independently or upon party motion. During the pendency of an appeal such mistakes may be so corrected before the record on appeal is transmitted to the appellate court and thereafter, while the appeal is pending, may be so corrected with leave of the appellate court.

(2) Newly Discovered Evidence. Dispositional orders may be modified based on newly discovered evidence when the court, in making this determination, shall make any modification consistent with the best interests of the child.

(3) Changed Circumstances. Court orders may be modified when changed circumstances and the best interests of the child require it.

(b) Relief from Judgments or Orders.

Orders may be set aside if:

(1) Obtained by fraud or mistake meeting civil action requirements;

(2) Court lacked jurisdiction over necessary parties or subject matter;

(3) Newly discovered evidence exists where the movant was without fault in failing to present such evidence at the original proceeding, and that such evidence may have resulted in a different judgment.

(c) Procedure. Parties, guardians ad litem, or interested persons may seek relief. Subdivisions (a)(1), (a)(2), and (b) require motions with notice under Rule 106. Subdivision (a)(3) requires petitions served under Rule 103.

(d) Disposition. Courts grant or deny relief based on evidence. Approved modifications may result in any permissible dispositional remedy or scheduling of new dispositional hearings.
