RULE 204: USE OF RESTRAINTS ON CHILDREN IN THE COURTROOM

(a) Restraints on children in juvenile court are permitted when the judge determines that:

(1) The behavior of the child represents a threat to his or her safety or the safety of other people in the courtroom; or

(2) The behavior of the child presents a substantial risk of flight from the courtroom; and

(3) There are no less restrictive alternatives to restraints that will prevent flight or risk of harm.

(b) Any party may request a hearing on restraint necessity, and judges must make findings on the record explaining their restraint decisions.

Advisory Commission Comments:

The Commission emphasizes that restraints should be individually determined based on specific factors, including: charge severity, delinquency history, past disruptive conduct, escape attempts, and courtroom security conditions.

The guidance specifically notes that restraints on these children are particularly inappropriate in most circumstances when children have experienced abuse or neglect or have disabilities. Additionally, restraints impair attorney-client communication, as juveniles have limited understanding of the criminal justice system and the roles of the institutional actors within it.
