RULE 403: FOSTER CARE REVIEW BOARD

(a) Scheduling and Notice. The court determines the date, time, and location of each foster care review board, notifying the Department of Children's Services and board members no later than 14 calendar days prior. All parties, attorneys, guardians ad litem, and foster parents receive written notice at least 10 calendar days before the scheduled review.

(b) Documentation. The Department provides supporting documentation regarding the child's safety, well-being, and permanency as determined by local rule, submitted to the court facilitator no less than 7 calendar days prior for distribution to board members.

(c) Quorum and Attendance. The court facilitator verifies quorum exists before each review and inquires about conflicts of interest requiring recusal. The review proceeds only if all necessary absent persons received proper notification; otherwise, rescheduling occurs.

(d) Conduct of the Review. The board uses a summary form to gather information from persons present or documentation provided by parties. Only parties, attorneys, the child, and the guardian ad litem may remain throughout; other necessary persons present information in parties' presence. The board may hear from the child separately.

(e) Recommendations. The board makes written recommendations addressing safety, well-being, and permanency, deliberating outside parties' presence. Recommendations require majority agreement; absent consensus, the court facilitator identifies conflicts and may make a direct referral to court.

(f) Announcement and Next Review. After deliberation, the board announces recommendations and schedules the next review. The court facilitator obtains all parties' signatures on the summary form.

(g) Summary Form Filed. The court facilitator files the summary form with the clerk, who records filing time and sends copies to all parties and attorneys.

(h) Judicial Review. The court receives recommendations within 10 judicial days to review whether they serve the child's best interest and confirms them as court orders at subsequent hearings.

(i) Direct Referral. When warranted, the court facilitator files direct referrals per T.C.A. Section 37-2-406(c)(1)(B) and informs the board of outcomes.

(j) Statements of Child. Any statements made by a child at the review are not admissible in a delinquent or unruly proceeding prior to a dispositional hearing.
