RULE 201: PRELIMINARY INQUIRY AND INFORMAL ADJUSTMENT

(a) Purposes. The juvenile court preliminary inquiry aims to:

(1) Resolve complaints by excluding matters where: the court lacks jurisdiction; insufficient evidence exists; or the matter is not serious enough for official action or should be referred elsewhere;

(2) Commence proceedings only when necessary for child welfare or public safety.

(b) Receipt of Complaint. Any person or agency may file a complaint with the juvenile court alleging a child is delinquent or unruly. The receiving officer must note the date and time.

(c) Duties of Designated Court Officer. Upon receipt, the officer shall:

(1) Interview the complainant, victim, and witnesses;

(2) Interview the child and parents or guardians, explaining the complaint, right to counsel, appointment eligibility, and rights regarding statements;

(3) Close the complaint if jurisdiction is lacking or evidence is insufficient.

(d) Informal Adjustment.

(1) If the matter is not serious enough for formal proceedings, the officer may provide counsel through informal adjustment without requiring admission. Considerations include child's home, school, and community problems, parental cooperation, assessments, attitude, prior history, victim concerns, and the child's age and maturity.

(2) Adjustment requires consent from the child and parents, with notification that participation is optional and terminable.

(3) The process cannot exceed 3 months (extendable to 6 months by court approval) and cannot impose financial obligations or restitution.

(4) Successful completion closes the complaint; if a petition was filed, it is dismissed with prejudice.

(5) The officer may terminate if the child or parents decline participation, deny jurisdiction, request court determination, or fail to comply.

(6) Termination requires notice to the child, parents, and victim, including the termination basis.

(e) Informal Adjustment Deemed Inappropriate. If inappropriate, formal proceedings commence via petition or citation filing.

(f) Statements of Child. Statements made during preliminary inquiry or informal adjustment are inadmissible in the subject delinquent or unruly proceeding prior to the dispositional hearing.
