RULE 112: ATTENDANCE OF PARTIES AND OTHER NECESSARY PERSONS

(a) Initial Inquiry by Court. At the beginning of each hearing, the court shall ascertain whether all necessary persons are before the court, which may include the child, parents (including alleged biological fathers), guardian or other custodian, and other parties and participants to the proceeding. If a necessary person is not present, the court shall determine whether notice of the hearing was provided to that person and whether the hearing may proceed.

(b) Responsibility of Department when Party to Proceeding. If a parent's identity or whereabouts are unknown and the Department of Children's Services is a party to the proceedings, the court shall ascertain whether the Department has made reasonable efforts to determine the identity and the whereabouts of the absent parent and include such finding in its order.

(c) Participation by Contemporaneous Means. In any proceeding, for good cause shown in compelling circumstances and with appropriate safeguards, the court may permit participation in open court by contemporaneous audio-visual transmission from a different location. However, during a delinquent or unruly adjudicatory hearing, a witness may only testify from a different location if the child has waived the right to confrontation.
