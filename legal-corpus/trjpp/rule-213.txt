RULE 213: MODIFICATION OF OR RELIEF FROM JUDGMENTS OR ORDERS

(a) Except in cases where the petition has been heard upon the merits and dismissed, the procedures herein shall be followed to obtain appropriate relief under this rule.

(b) Modification of Orders.

(1) Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes and errors arising from oversight or omission in orders or other parts of the record may be corrected by the court at any time on its own initiative or on motion of any party.

(2) Modification for Changed Circumstances. An order may be modified if circumstances have changed since entry and the child's best interests require it; however, orders committing delinquent or unruly children to the Department of Children's Services or dismissal orders cannot be modified on these grounds.

(3) Modification for Newly Discovered Evidence. A dispositional order may be modified based on newly discovered evidence consistent with the child's best interests.

(c) Relief from Judgments or Orders.

An order shall be set aside if determined that:

(1) It was obtained by fraud or mistake meeting legal requirements applicable to civil actions;

(2) The court lacked jurisdiction over necessary parties or subject matter; or

(3) Newly discovered evidence requires it, provided the movant was without fault in failing to present such evidence originally and it might have resulted in a different judgment.

(d) Procedure. Any party, probation officer, or interested person may seek relief through a motion stating concise grounds. Notice of hearing must be given to affected parties.

(e) Disposition. The court shall deny or grant relief based on evidence, and may order permissible dispositions or schedule a new dispositional hearing.
