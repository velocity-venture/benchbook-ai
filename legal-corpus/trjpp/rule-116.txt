RULE 116: STANDARD OF PROOF

In any hearing in which the standard of proof is not expressly designated by statute or rule, the standard of proof shall be preponderance of the evidence.

Advisory Commission Comments:

While most juvenile court hearings have designated standards, some do not -- such as competency hearings or hearings regarding pretrial diversion approval. In these cases, the preponderance of the evidence standard applies as the default threshold.
