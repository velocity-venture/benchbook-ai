RULE 105: RESPONSIVE PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS

(a) Answer. A written answer to a petition shall not be required.

(b) Motion.

(1) Court applications for orders must be made by motion. Unless presented during a hearing or trial, motions must be written, state grounds with specificity, and identify the requested relief or order.

(2) Upon motion filing, the clerk schedules a tentative hearing date.

(3) All motions must include the anticipated hearing date and be served on parties a reasonable time prior to that date.

(4) A written response to a motion shall not be required.

Advisory Commission Comments:

This rule replaced the former Rule 20 of Tennessee Rules of Juvenile Procedure. The Commission clarifies that while written responses are not mandated, they remain permissible. Local rules should define reasonable notice timeframes, considering local docket variations. The notes also reference Supreme Court Rule 10B procedures for judge disqualification or recusal motions in juvenile courts.
