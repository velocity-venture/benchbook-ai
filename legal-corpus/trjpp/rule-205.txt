RULE 205: NOTIFICATION AND WAIVER OF RIGHTS OF CHILDREN

(a) Right To Attorney.

(1) Notification of Right to Attorney. Courts must expressly inform children entitled to legal representation of this right. If a child waives representation, the court shall advise of the continuing right to an attorney at all stages of the proceedings.

(2) Waiver of Right to an Attorney. A child's waiver is only valid when:
- The child has been fully informed of attorney rights
- The child knowingly and voluntarily waives the right
- The waiver is confirmed in writing by the child

(3) Appointment of Attorney. Courts must appoint an attorney for entitled children who cannot afford one or whose parents refuse to hire one, with fees assessed per T.C.A. Section 37-1-150.

(b) Notification And Waiver of Additional Rights at a Hearing.

(1) Rights Advisement. Courts must inform unrepresented children of rights including: remaining silent, pleading not guilty, obtaining a trial, confronting witnesses, presenting testimony, subpoenaing evidence, and appealing with information on the time limits for and manner in which the right to appeal can be perfected.

(2) Represented Children. Attorneys must fully advise represented children of constitutional and statutory rights, though courts retain obligations to advise and confirm knowing waivers.

(3) Unrepresented Children. Unrepresented children cannot waive rights unless courts fully advise them and determine the waiver is knowing and voluntary after the child has consulted with a knowledgeable adult who has no interest adverse to the child.

(c) Knowing and Voluntary Waivers.

(1) Criteria. Courts accept waivers only if children can make intelligent decisions based on mental condition, age, education, experience, case complexity, or other relevant factors.

(2) Procedure. All waivers must occur orally in open court and be confirmed in writing by both child and judge, with courts confirming attorney right waivers before proceeding.
