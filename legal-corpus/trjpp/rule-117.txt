RULE 117: ENTRY OF ORDER

(a) Effective. Entry of a court order is effective when an order containing one of the following is marked on the face by the clerk as filed for entry:

(1) the signatures of the judge or magistrate and all parties or counsel, or

(2) the signatures of the judge or magistrate and one party or counsel with a certificate of counsel that a copy of the proposed order has been served on all other parties or counsel, or

(3) the signature of the judge or magistrate and a certificate of the clerk that a copy has been served on all other parties or counsel.

(b) Duties of Clerk. Following the entry of order, the clerk shall make appropriate docket notations and shall copy the order on the minutes, but failure to do so will not affect the validity of entry of the order. When requested by counsel or self-represented parties, the clerk shall without delay mail or deliver a copy of the entered order to all parties or counsel. If the clerk fails to do so, a party prejudiced by that failure may seek relief under Rule 213 in delinquent or unruly cases and Rule 310 in dependent and neglect cases.
