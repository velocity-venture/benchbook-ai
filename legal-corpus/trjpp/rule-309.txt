RULE 309: AGREED ORDERS

(a) General Provisions. Any or all issues within a case may be resolved by a written agreement between all parties, submitted to the court in the form of an agreed order. An agreed order, when signed by all parties or counsel and approved by the court, becomes an official court order. The agreement should note that parties understand this constitutes a court order and that non-compliance may result in contempt charges.

(b) Modification. An agreed order may be modified in accordance with Rule 310.

Advisory Commission Comments:

All parties to original proceedings -- including the Department of Children's Services and any interveners -- must consent for an order to qualify as agreed. Parties wishing to withdraw may request court approval for dismissal.

A 2018 comment noted the rule permits courts to accept stipulations entered by parties during pending cases.
