RULE 210: ADJUDICATORY HEARINGS

Scope. The adjudicatory hearing determines whether evidence supports findings that a child is delinquent or unruly and needs treatment or rehabilitation.

Timing Requirements. Cases involving detained children must be heard within 30 days of placement outside the home. All other cases should be heard within 30 days of petition filing if reasonable, with a maximum 90-day deadline for all cases.

Hearing Procedures. Courts must verify the child's identity and relationship to parties, confirm proper notice, explain hearing purposes and consequences, and inform parties of their rights.

Evidence Standards. Only formally admitted evidence may be considered under Tennessee Rules of Evidence. The court shall consider only evidence which has been formally admitted at the adjudicatory hearing. All testimony shall be under oath and may be in narrative form.

Delinquency Adjudication. Requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. A finding of guilt triggers a separate hearing on whether treatment is needed; adjudication occurs only if the court finds treatment necessary.

Unruly Adjudication. Requires proof by clear and convincing evidence, followed by the same two-step process as delinquency cases.
