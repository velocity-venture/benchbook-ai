RULE 211: DISPOSITIONAL HEARINGS

(a) Time Limits on Scheduling Dispositional Hearings. Dispositional hearings must occur within 15 days of the adjudicatory hearing if the child is in detention, or within 90 days for all other cases. Continuances are permitted upon good cause.

(b) Separate from Adjudicatory Hearing. The dispositional hearing is separate and distinct from the adjudicatory hearing though it may follow immediately or occur later.

(c) Notice of Right to Appeal. The court must inform the child of appellate rights at the conclusion of the dispositional hearing.

(d) Temporary Order. During continuances, courts may issue temporary orders serving the child's best interest, including detention when necessary for protection or ensuring appearance.

(e) Evidence Admissible; Standard of Proof. The court considers only formally admitted evidence and juvenile court records. All testimony shall be under oath and may be in narrative form. Reliable hearsay, including psychological evaluations and probation reports, is admissible with opportunity for rebuttal. The standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence.
