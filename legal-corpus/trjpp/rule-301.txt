RULE 301: INITIATION OF CASES

A dependent and neglect case is commenced by filing a petition. When the petitioner is not the Department of Children's Services, the court shall promptly refer the case to the Department for investigation.

Advisory Commission Comments:

This rule establishes how dependent and neglect cases begin in juvenile court. The previous informal adjustment practice has been discontinued.

Cases may be initiated by the Department of Children's Services, a private party, or the court itself. The clerk cannot prevent someone from filing a petition under applicable law.

When intake court officers receive allegations suggesting a child is dependent and neglected, they must assist in petition filing and refer matters to the Department. Private parties may file petitions regardless of officer assistance, and officers can make referrals even if no petition is filed.

Courts may exercise emergency authority to protect children already under jurisdiction on other petition types through bench orders. In such situations, a dependent and neglect petition must be filed within 48 hours, excluding non-judicial days, per T.C.A. Section 37-1-117.

Subsequent petitions alleging material change of circumstances following case disposition shall be treated as continuations of the original case, unless new allegations arise.
