RULE 304: INTERVENTION

(a) Intervention as of Right. Upon timely application, anyone shall be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a provision of the Tennessee Constitution, the United States Constitution, or a statute confers an unconditional right to intervene; or (2) when the applicant claims an interest relating to the subject matter of the action and the applicant is so situated that the disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the applicant's ability to protect that interest unless the applicant's interest is adequately represented by an existing party; or (3) by written stipulation of all of the parties.

(b) Permissive Intervention. Upon timely application, anyone may be permitted to intervene in an action: (1) when a statute confers a conditional right to intervene; or (2) when an applicant's claim or defense and the main action have a question of law or fact in common. In exercising its discretion, the court shall consider whether intervention will unduly delay or prejudice the adjudication of the rights of the original parties.

(c) Procedure. Except for interventions for the purpose of modification of an order pursuant to Rule 310, anyone desiring to intervene shall serve a written motion to intervene upon the parties as provided in Rule 103. The motion shall state the grounds for the requested intervention and shall further state the claim or defense for which intervention is sought. For a person seeking to intervene as a matter of right, the motion shall state the statute or constitutional provision which gives the person the right to intervene. The court shall conduct a hearing on the motion to intervene as soon as practicable after filing of the motion.
