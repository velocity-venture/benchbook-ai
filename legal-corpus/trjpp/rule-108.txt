RULE 108: INJUNCTIVE RELIEF

(a) How Obtained. Relief may be obtained through: (1) An ex parte restraining order; (2) An injunction issued during the pendency of a matter; or (3) An injunction issued as part of a dispositional order. All requests must disclose whether previous applications have been refused by any court.

(b) In General. Orders must be specific in terms and shall describe in reasonable detail the act restrained or enjoined. They require judicial signature, dating with time of issuance, and court filing. Orders bind parties, their representatives, and others with actual notice.

(c) Ex Parte Restraining Order. These orders shall only restrict the doing of an act and require probable cause, finding either that a child may abscond or there is a danger of immediate harm to a child such that a delay for a hearing would be likely to result in severe or irreparable harm. Orders expire within 15 days unless extended or consented to. When interfering with parental rights, a preliminary hearing must occur within 72 hours.

(d) Injunction. Injunctions may restrict or mandate actions. Prior to issuance, the court shall afford the party to be enjoined notice, grounds therefore, and an opportunity to be heard. The standard is preponderance of evidence. Courts issue them when conduct is or may be harmful to the child.

(e) Injunctive Relief Against Non-Party. Courts may issue orders against non-parties whose conduct is harmful to the child, without conferring party status in the underlying case.
