RULE 114: CONFIDENTIALITY OF PROCEEDINGS

(a) Dependent and Neglect Proceedings. Dependent and neglect cases shall not be open to the public.

(b) Delinquent and Unruly Proceedings. Delinquent and unruly cases are open to the public. However, courts may exclude the general public from proceedings. On party application or court initiative, proceedings may be closed except to those with direct case interest. When evaluating closure, courts must apply these standards:

(1) When closure is sought by a party:

(A) The party seeking to close the hearing shall have the burden of proof.

(B) Courts cannot close proceedings unless closure prevents particularized prejudice that overrides public interest in open proceedings.

(C) Any order of closure must not be broader than necessary to protect the determined interests.

(2) Courts must consider reasonable alternatives to closure.

(3) Courts must make adequate written findings supporting closure orders.

Advisory Commission Comments:

Dependent and neglect cases should remain closed to the public, limited to necessary participants. The rule references State v. James, 902 S.W.2d 911 (Tenn. 1995), authorizing this closure process for delinquent and unruly cases.
