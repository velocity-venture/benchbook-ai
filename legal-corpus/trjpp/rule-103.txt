RULE 103: SERVICE OF PROCESS AND SUMMONS

(a) General Provisions. After petition filing, the clerk schedules a hearing and issues summonses to parties, including children alleged to be delinquent, unruly, or dependent and neglected (if 14 or more years old). A copy of the petition shall accompany the summons unless the summons is served by publication in which case the published summons shall indicate the general nature of the allegations and indicate where to obtain the full petition.

(b) Order to Appear and Bring Child to Hearing. The court may endorse an order on the summons requiring parents, guardians, or custodians to appear personally and bring the child to the hearing.

(c) Service of Summons.

(1) Except for emergency, preliminary, or detention hearings, in-state parties must receive personal service at least 3 days before hearing. If the party cannot be found but their address is known or ascertainable, service may occur by registered or certified mail at least 5 days before the hearing. Out-of-state parties may be served personally or by registered or certified mail at least 5 days prior. Service by mail is complete upon mailing.

(2) If a child is removed from home, service attempts must precede emergency or detention hearings when feasible.

(3) When parties cannot be located after reasonable effort, the court may order service of the summons upon the party by publication in accordance with T.C.A. Sections 21-1-203 and 204.

(4) Any suitable person not a party and at least 18 years old may serve the summons.

(5) Courts may authorize payment of service costs and travel expenses.

(6) Foreign service follows Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure Rule 4A.
