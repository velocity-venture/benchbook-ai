RULE 306: TAKING CHILDREN'S TESTIMONY

(a) Any examination of a child witness shall be conducted in a manner that takes into account the child's age and developmental level. Such testimony shall be recorded.

(b) When a child testifies, the examination shall be conducted either in chambers or in a courtroom which has been cleared of observers and non-party witnesses.

(c) Upon motion of any party or upon its own initiative and upon good cause shown based upon the best interest of the child, the court may order one or more of the following accommodations:

(1) Arrangement of the courtroom or chambers so that certain individuals are not within the child's line of vision;

(2) Exclusion of the parties from chambers or the courtroom while the child is testifying;

(3) Examination of the child through written questions and written answers;

(4) Observation by the parties of the child's testimony by closed circuit television or other contemporaneous audio-visual transmission;

(5) Examination of the child by the court rather than directly by the parties or attorneys;

(6) Allowing the presence of a properly trained comfort animal;

(7) Permitting the child to have a stuffed animal or similar comfort toy while testifying; or

(8) Permitting the child to be accompanied by a support person who is not a party or a witness.

(d) If the court excludes parties while the child testifies, counsel for all parties and children, including guardians ad litem, shall be present. The court shall inform unrepresented parties of their right to counsel and appoint counsel if requested by an indigent party entitled to representation.

(e) If the court examines the child rather than permitting direct party examination, the court shall ensure: (1) parties or counsel, guardians ad litem, and attorneys ad litem submit written questions prior to testimony, which the court shall ask as written; (2) objections to questions are made in writing with opportunity for response before sustaining; (3) after submitted questions are completed, the court recesses to allow attorney-client consultation and submission of additional written questions; and (4) this process continues until no further questions exist.
